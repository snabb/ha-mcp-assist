# Tool Reference

MCP Assist exposes Home Assistant through MCP tools. The exact tool list depends
on shared server settings, per-profile overrides, provider capabilities, and
which Home Assistant integrations are installed.

## Core Tools

These are the main tools the assistant uses for Home Assistant discovery and
control.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `get_index` | Return the compact Smart Entity Index |
| `discover_entities` | Find exposed entities by area, domain, device class, state, name, or inferred type |
| `get_entity_details` | Read exact state, attributes, and metadata for one or more entities |
| `perform_action` | Execute supported Home Assistant actions against exposed entities |
| `run_script` | Run a Home Assistant script and return response data when available |
| `run_automation` | Trigger a Home Assistant automation manually |
| `list_areas` | List Home Assistant areas |
| `list_domains` | List entity domains available to the assistant |
| `set_conversation_state` | Track whether the assistant expects a follow-up |

## Device Tools

Device tools help when the user refers to a physical device instead of a single
entity.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `discover_devices` | Find Home Assistant devices and related entities |
| `get_device_details` | Read device metadata and associated exposed entities |

Use these for requests like "turn off the thermostat display" or "what entities
belong to the bedroom lamp device?"

## Assist Bridge Tools

Assist bridge tools expose additional Home Assistant Assist context when
enabled.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `list_assist_tools` | List available Assist bridge tools |
| `call_assist_tool` | Call an exposed Assist tool |
| `get_assist_prompt` | Read Assist prompt context |
| `get_assist_context_snapshot` | Inspect the current Assist context snapshot |

## Third-Party LLM API Bridge Tools

The LLM API Bridge exposes allowlisted third-party Home Assistant LLM APIs
registered by other integrations. It is disabled by default.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `list_llm_apis` | List registered non-Assist LLM APIs and allowlist status |
| `list_llm_api_tools` | Inspect tools exposed by one allowlisted LLM API |
| `call_llm_api_tool` | Call a tool on one allowlisted LLM API |
| `get_llm_api_prompt` | Read prompt text from one allowlisted LLM API |

Use `list_llm_api_tools` before `call_llm_api_tool` so arguments match the
third-party API's schema. The built-in Home Assistant `assist` API stays on the
Assist Bridge tools.

## Response-Service Read Tools

These tools read structured data from Home Assistant services that return
responses.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `get_calendar_events` | Read calendar events from exposed calendar entities |
| `list_response_services` | List response-capable Home Assistant services |
| `call_service_with_response` | Call a response-capable service directly |

For normal weather questions, prefer `get_weather_forecast`.

## Weather Forecast

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `get_weather_forecast` | Find and summarize Home Assistant weather forecasts |

Requirements:

- A `weather.` entity exposed to the conversation assistant.
- The **Weather Forecast** tool family enabled.
- A weather integration that supports at least one forecast type.

## Recorder History

Recorder tools answer questions about past entity state.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `get_entity_history` | Read recent state history for an entity |
| `get_entity_history` with `mode: "last_event"` | Find the last matching state event |
| `analyze_entity_history` | Count, summarize, or analyze state changes over a period |
| `get_entity_state_at_time` | Read an entity state at a point in time |

These tools require Home Assistant recorder data for the relevant entities and
time range. Use `period: "today"` or `period: "yesterday"` for calendar-day
questions instead of approximating with a number of hours.
Count analyses count transitions into the matching state, not repeated recorder
rows that report the same state.

## Calculator and Unit Conversion

Calculator tools are useful when exact arithmetic matters.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide` | Basic arithmetic |
| `sqrt`, `power`, `round_number` | Common math operations |
| `average`, `min_value`, `max_value` | Aggregate numbers |
| `evaluate_expression` | Evaluate a bounded math expression |
| `convert_unit` | Convert common units, including cooking volumes |

Calculator and unit conversion are separate tool families so profiles can expose
one without the other.

Kitchen conversions support `cup`, `tablespoon`, `teaspoon`, `ml`, and `pint`.
Fractional values such as `1/8` and `1 1/2` can be passed as the conversion
value.

## Memory

Memory tools persist user-approved facts and preferences.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `list_memory_categories` | List suggested categories and active memory counts |
| `remember_memory` | Store a memory with optional TTL |
| `recall_memories` | Search stored memories |
| `forget_memory` | Delete matching stored memories |

The assistant should use memory only when the user asks it to remember, recall,
or forget something. Suggested categories include `preference`, `routine`,
`device_alias`, `automation_note`, `baseline`, `correction`, `maintenance`, and
`household`; custom categories still work. Memories are shared across MCP Assist
profiles.

## Web Search and URL Reading

Web tools are optional and controlled by shared provider settings.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `search` | Search the web with DuckDuckGo, Brave Search, or SearXNG |
| `read_url` | Fetch and extract content from a specific URL |

Use Home Assistant-native tools first for local Home Assistant data such as
weather, calendars, history, and entity state.
`read_url` favors main page content over navigation chrome where possible and
keeps longer summary excerpts for page-inspection workflows.

## Google Places and Routes

Google Places and Routes tools are optional and require a Google Maps API key.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `search_google_places` | Search for businesses and places, including open status, address, phone, and rating when available |
| `get_google_place_details` | Fetch details for a Google Places result |
| `get_google_route` | Calculate travel time, distance, and traffic-aware ETAs |

If `get_google_route` is called without an origin, it can use the configured
Home Assistant home latitude and longitude only when **Share Home Location with
MCP Tools** is enabled. Use regular web search for broad location research that
is not a place lookup or route question.

## Wikipedia Search

Wikipedia Search is an optional lightweight reference tool.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `search_wikipedia` | Search Wikipedia article titles and descriptions |

Use this for stable background or encyclopedia-style questions where Wikipedia
results are enough. Use regular web search for latest information, current
events, or broader internet research.

## Music Assistant

Music Assistant tools are available when the Home Assistant Music Assistant
integration is installed and the tool family is enabled.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `list_music_assistant_players` | List Music Assistant media players |
| `play_music_assistant` | Play media through Music Assistant |
| `list_music_assistant_instances` | List configured Music Assistant instances |
| `search_music_assistant` | Search Music Assistant tracks, albums, artists, playlists, radio, audiobooks, and podcasts |
| `get_music_assistant_library` | Browse Music Assistant library content |
| `get_music_assistant_queue` | Inspect a player queue |
| `control_music_assistant_player` | Pause, resume, skip, seek, adjust volume, shuffle, repeat, or clear queues |
| `transfer_music_assistant_queue` | Move an active queue to another Music Assistant player |

Use player names, areas, floors, labels, or entity IDs to narrow ambiguous
player requests. Search and library browsing support Music Assistant tracks,
albums, artists, playlists, radio, audiobooks, and podcasts when those media
types are available from the configured Music Assistant instance.

## Image Tools

Image tools depend on provider and source support.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `analyze_image` | Ask the active multimodal model about a camera snapshot, image entity, URL, or local image |
| `get_image` | Return an image as an MCP image content block |
| `generate_image` | Generate an image when the active provider exposes compatible image generation |

Only use these when the provider and client can support the requested image
workflow.

## External Custom Tools

External custom tools are user-provided Python packages under:

```text
<home-assistant-config>/mcp-assist-tools
```

They are disabled by default and should only be enabled for packages you trust.
See [External Custom Tools](custom-tools.md).

## Tool Selection Tips

- Use `discover_entities` before `perform_action` unless the entity ID is known
  and unambiguous.
- Treat area, domain, and other discovery criteria as strict filters. Do not add
  the current area to an explicitly named target unless the user located it
  there; retry without inferred filters when a name search returns no results.
- Use `get_entity_details` when exact state or attributes matter.
- Use device tools when the user refers to physical hardware rather than one
  entity.
- Use Home Assistant-native reads before web search for local data.
- Keep optional tool families disabled unless a profile needs them.
